# Historical-Price-of-Gold-Time-Series-Analysis

This project focuses on performing a time series analysis of the historical price of gold. The dataset used for this analysis contains historical gold price data spanning several years. The main objective is to explore and analyze the patterns, trends, and seasonality in the price of gold over time.

## Libraries Used

* pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
* seaborn: Used for creating visually appealing statistical graphics.
* matplotlib: Used for generating various types of plots and visualizations.

## Data Cleaning

The initial dataset required some cleaning to prepare it for analysis. The following steps were performed as part of the data cleaning process:

Changed the index of the data frame to the "Year" column, allowing for easier time-based analysis.
Renamed certain columns to improve clarity and enhance readability.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies (pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib).
Open the notebook or script containing the analysis.
Execute the code cells or run the script to perform the time series analysis on the historical gold price data.
Explore the results, visualizations, and any insights derived from the analysis.
